## Mathematics Applied to Telecommunicaitons and Energy Research Group

Our group is focused on the applications of several areas of mathematics to the solution of problems that arise in comples network systems, such as the Internet or the energy grid. With a strong background in Control, Optimization, Probability, Stochastic Processes and Queueing theory, we tackle these problems through an interdisciplinary approach, combining solid mathematical models with engineering insights, and devise new algorithms to test in practical systems.

#### About the name...

Our acronym <strong>MATE</strong> (pronounced Matte) stands for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9">traditional infusion</a> we drink in Uruguay. Rich in caffeine, we rely on it to power our research every day.
